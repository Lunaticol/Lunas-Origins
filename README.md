<summary><strong>Ignea</strong> (Impact: 游댮游댮游댮)</summary>

# Precatio Ignea

`A fiery tank, who sacrificed everything for the safety of the Blazeborns.`

**Precatio Ignia**
_After the long lost war against the Aquatics, the Blazeborns were weakened. You've risen as their protector, exchanging everything you once loved for their safety._

**Blazing Fury**
Fire an incredibly accurate small fireball, doing medium damage.

**Soul Explosion**
Explode in a massive explosion of Soul Power, doing heavy damage to anyone near you, lighting yourself aflame.

**Flame Empowerment**
When set aflame, you will take 20% less damage, and begin to heal a small amount of health.

**Physical Heat**
You can consume Blaze Rods for food, or use Blaze Powder to ignite yourself for long periods of time. [Note: Due to a bug with Apugli, I have had to make it where you can only do this with a stack of one.]

**Un-ending War**
You must slay the Aquatics who wronged your kin long ago. You have to.

**Immune System**
You are immune to some negative effects, but also burn through the positive ones.

**Nether Spawn**
**Fire Immunity**
**Damage from Potions**

**Enhanced Weakness**
While you may be a better Blazeborn, your weaknesses have also been amplified. Snowballs hurt a lot more now.

**Something Missing**
You seem to be missing... something. Without it, you can not learn, or utilize that wisdom into the arcane magicks.

**Quick Demise**
Your flame's temperatures have reached levels high enough to dissipate rain, but not enough to get rid of water. You will melt much quicker than a regular Blazeborn.

**Snuffed Out**
Your flame can be snuffed out easily by suffocation.
