  "description": "§6§nMass\n§6Mass controls your size, abilities, and hunger. Being low Mass will have you stay in the §cProtostar§6 phase. Around medium Mass will have you enter Main Sequence, and being high Mass will have you enter Inflation phase. At extreme Mass, you may use \nSupernova\n\n§6§nSupernova\n§6Supernova occurs at high Mass. It creates a massive explosion, and resets you to your §cProtostar §6phase. If you are at maximum Mass when you Supernova, you have a 50% chance to become a §bNeutron Star§6 or §0Black Hole§6.[Secondary]\n§6§nOrbital Field\n§6You may store up to [5] items in your Field.\n\n§6§nOrbit\n§6Using [Load Hotbar Activator], you may toggle the ability for entities to orbit you. This works better with §0Black Hole§6.\n\n§b§n Neutron Star\n§bAs a Neutron Star, you love storing things in your Orbit, and watching them orbit you.\n\n§b§nAdvanced Orbital Field\n§bYou may store up to [27] items in your Orbital Field\n\n§0§nBlack Hole\n§0Eat. Consume. Everyone and everything.\n\n§0§nAdvanced Orbit\n§0As nearby entities are dragged in, they will experience Hawking Radiation, and be extremely harmed. If they get too close, they will experience a \"Wormhole\" effect and be teleported, taking heavy damage and experiencing Nausea from such an event.\n\n§6Once your Mass reaches Zero as §bNeutron Star§6 or §0Black Hole§6, you will revert to Protostar stage. \n\n§c§nDrawbacks\n\n§c§nHeat Problems\n§cWhile in the Protostar stage, you do not have the heat to maintain yourself in water. You will take water damage, but not rain.\n\n§cAs a Main Sequence, your armour will decay until roughly 10% durability, unless it is Netherite.\n\n§c§nFuel Requirements\n\n§cAs a Protostar, you need 2x more food, but as a §0Black Hole§c, you need 4x.",
